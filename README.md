# File-Manager

There are currently 5 parameters to delete files: type (filename extension), size, creation date, modification date and accessed date

Instructions can be found by clicking the "help" button in the menu.

# Additional info:
File manager.py is the main program file to run.

If you want to test the code, test.py can be ran to create dummy files with different properties. The program will create a random folder in the 'test' folder, which contains the dummy files. test.py can be used by running it and inputing the amount of dummy files to create.
